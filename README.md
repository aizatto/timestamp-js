# timestamp

I use timestamps in a lot of my documents, so I want an easy way for me to copy timestamps.

This project came to me because I use timestamps in Google Docs, and was using a tool called Text Factory, but it was, insufficient, so I thought I'd make something more accessible.

This is a list of my commonly used timestamps.

Also experimenting with netlify to easily host simple demos.
