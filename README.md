# timestamp

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/aizatto/timestamp-js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

I use timestamps in a lot of my documents, so I want an easy way for me to copy timestamps.

See:
- https://timestamps.aizatto.com/
- https://vigilant-hodgkin-ddfa51.netlify.com/
- https://aizatto.github.io/timestamp-js/

This project came to me because I use timestamps in Google Docs, and was using a tool called Text Factory, but it was, insufficient, so I thought I'd make something more accessible.

This is a list of my commonly used timestamps.

Also experimenting with netlify to easily host simple demos.

# Possible Optimizations

- Move to SSR, currently using React for ease of use
  - Have to move "Copy" feature to frontend JS
